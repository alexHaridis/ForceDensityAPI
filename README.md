<h1>Force Density Method</h1>

![force-density-method-thumb](https://github.com/alexHaridis/ForceDensityAPI/assets/9630033/25b83ad2-8995-415a-bba7-bf96d069c54f)

<p>This is a standalone application for exploring the <em>Force Density Method (FDM)</em> with a regular grid structure. It is written in Java using the <a href="https://www.processing.org">Processing API</a> for graphic elements, geometry, rendering, and GUI. This application solves a grid with 36 nodes, 25 faces and 60 edges.</p>

<p>The FDM method implemented here follows the description of the method in: Klaus Linkwitz (2014) "Force Density Method," Ch.6 in S. Adriaenssens, P. Block, D. Veenendaal, &amp; C. Williams. <em>Shell Structures for Architecture: Form Finding and Optimization</em>.</p>

<p>For more information on the internal computational abstractions and the rest of the details of this implementation, please read the accompanying writeup called <em>InteractOptimGridShells.pdf</em>.</p>
