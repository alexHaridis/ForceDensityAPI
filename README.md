<p>This is a standalone application for exploring the <em>Force Density Method (FDM)</em> with a regular grid structure. It is written in Java using the <a href="https://www.processing.org">Processing API</a> for graphic elements, geometry, rendering, and GUI. This application solves a grid with 36 nodes, 25 faces and 60 edges.</p>

<p>The FDM method implemented here follows the description of the method in: Klaus Linkwitz, "Force Density Method," Ch.6 in Adriaenssens, S., Block, P., Veenendaal, D. &amp; Williams, C. 2014. <em>Shell Structures for Architecture: Form Finding and Optimization</em>, Taylor &amp; Francis.</p>
